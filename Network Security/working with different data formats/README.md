# working with spreadsheets

Gotta love how despite all the great tools that exist out there many companies still keep alot of information  
regarding the network in excel spreadsheets. Python has some excellent modules for this so we can parse  
and manipulate these files to our content.  

I have mainly used the openpyxl and xlsxwriter modules for these kind of tasks.
