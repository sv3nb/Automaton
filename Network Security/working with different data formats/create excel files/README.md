Just a quick demonstration on working with JSON, regex and the xlsxwriter lib.

1) Read in the networks via JSON
2) perform a keywords-based search with regex
3) assign networks to appropriate list
4) create excel spreadsheet with security zone assignment (each zone is represented on a separate row)
