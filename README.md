# Automaton: The network security engineer' code toolbelt

This will be a generic repository holding scripts and tools that don't belong to a any specific larger project.  
The code provided in this repo is based on various tasks and smaller projects encountered during my professional assignments.

I will try to make the code as modular as possible so it can easily be re-used.
