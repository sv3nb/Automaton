# MITRE ATT&CK based scripts

This is a collection of scripts that revolve around working with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  
I mainly utilized the pandas library to structure and enrich the data, starting from a matrices based on the techniques  
used by the FIN6 and Spider Wizard threat groups.  
I also played with the beautfiful soup and lxml libraries to demonstrate some web scraping capabilities.  
I also intend to explore the stix2 library a bit deeper in the near future.  

To initially construct the FIN6 and Spider Wizard matrices i used the attack navigator tool.
