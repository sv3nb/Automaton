# MITRE ATT&CK based scripts

This is a collection of scripts that revolve around working with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  
I mainly utilized the pandas library to structure and enrich the data, starting from a matrix  
based on the techniques used by the FIN6 threat group.  
I also played with beautfiful soup and lxml libraries to demonstrate some web scraping capabilities. 
I also intend to explore the stix2 library a bit deeper in the near future.  

To initially construct the FIN6 and Spider Wizard matriced i used the attack navigator tool.
