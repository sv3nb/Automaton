Just an example i created based on a real life task i had to do.  
Essentially it demonstrates creating a list from one worksheet to match items on a different worksheet.  
Then extract information from the first Inventory worksheet and generate some commands with it.  
The script was created to demonstrate working with spreadsheet files, regex expressions and file operations.
